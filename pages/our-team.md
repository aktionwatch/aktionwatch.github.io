Meet Georgia Tsavala, our President. With a rich background in environmental and cultural initiatives, she's the perfect fit for our organization. Georgia, a former primary school teacher from Vonitsa, has championed sustainability in education and participated in the European Union's Comenius project. Her years of experience as a primary school principal have honed her organizational and leadership skills.

A devoted cultural advocate, Georgia is a founding member of a local cultural organization and has played a key role in the Vonitsa, Etoile-sur-Rhone, Viggiano, and Polaniec twinning project. Her dedication also extends to animal welfare, rescuing and rehoming hundreds of stray animals over the past decade.

As President of Aktion Watch, Georgia's expertise, passion, and commitment to sustainability, cultural preservation, and animal welfare will guide our mission to create a brighter future for all. We're excited to see the lasting impact her experience and leadership will make on our community and beyond.
