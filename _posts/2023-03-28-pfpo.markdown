Aktion Watch recently participated in the first online meeting of the Animal Welfare and Environmental Federation (P.F.P.O) on Saturday, March 5th. As an association dedicated to promoting local action for sustainable development, we recognize the critical importance of animal welfare and environmental protection.
The meeting brought together organizations from across Greece to discuss the challenges facing animal welfare and the environment, and to explore potential solutions. Aktion Watch was honored to be a part of this vital conversation and looks forward to collaborating with other organizations to make a positive impact.
Our thoughts are also with those affected by the recent train tragedy in Tempi. We extend our deepest condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery to those injured. At Aktion Watch, we believe that protecting the environment and promoting safety go hand in hand, and we are committed to supporting efforts that prioritize both.
